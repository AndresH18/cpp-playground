# C++ Playground

This repository contains projects where I try new features of C++, some proof of concepts and test/try new framework.

## Projects

* [File Viewer](File_Viewer):
  This project uses Qt to create a window with a tree structure of the file system and an
  editor to edit and save files.
* [Banking System](Banking-System):
  This project uses Qt to create a window where we can see a list of users. When a user is selected we can see the list
  of their account's balance. When an account is selected we can see more detailed information on the right label.  
  This project help me grasp more concepts about C++ and Qt.
